# elliptic-curve-in-go

i want to learn go and also do some cryptography

i'll be implementing this algo from scratch without using any cryptography libraries https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf

what this should look like at the end

- i can generate keys pair by command
- i can customize the keys (their sizes, anything else tbh) also i want to see if i can generate the keys as emojis but thats a stretch goal
- i just want to write something in go and see how it goes
- hopefully this will keep me accountable
